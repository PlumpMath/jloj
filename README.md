# Jloj

Jloj is:

 * A core library to enhance interoperability between Java 8 and Clojure
 * A compiler for generating Java source code using a restricted subset of Java,
   specifically targeting Clojure-interop.

While the Jloj subset has hallmarks of an ML, you're better off going
with [Yeti](https://mth.github.io/yeti/),
[MLj](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mlj/index.html),
or [OCaml-Java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) for a real ML on the JVM.
The Jloj subset is only concerned with writing better Java code.
